# Pose-estimation
      Pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, enabling the detection
      and tracking of human body parts. It plays a crucial role in a wide range of
      applications, from human-computer interaction to motion analysis and sports
      analytics. This project explores the applications of various ML/DL algorithms like SVM,
      Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and also MediaPipe, to the task of human pose estimation.
      The goal is to accurately detect and track the movements and positions of human body in
      real-time.
